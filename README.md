#Written Description - Trends 

1 - This data set's tumor treatment population includes four mice Out of the three drugs, the Capomulin treatment groups's average volume decreased from 45 mm3 to 36.23 mm3. However, the remaining three group's tumor increased between 46% and 57% and Ketapril group's tumor volume increased the most reaching at 57% which is much worse than the placebo group. 

2 - The second graph displays the metastatic spread during the treatment and the drug Capomulin has the least spread and placebo has the most metastatic spread. When we pull on the 45 day graph, Capomulin group has the highest survivial rate and infubinol on the opther hand has the lowest survival rate. 

3 -  By all these observations, it can be concluded that Capomulin is the most promising drug for this sepcific kind of tumor
